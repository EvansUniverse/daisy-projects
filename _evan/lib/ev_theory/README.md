Various musical functionalities for the Electrosmith Daisy platform.
* [tempo](tempo.h) - Metronome/tempo with BPM detection
* [chord](chord.h) - Chord with lots of options for modifications and extensions
* [arp](arp.h) - Arpeggiator
* [theory](theory.h) - General purpose utilities pertaining Daisy and music theory: notes, quantization, note -> voltage conversion, etc. Honestly, a better name for it would be "utils".
* [midi](midi.h) - MIDI functionalities (that aren't covered by LibDaisy)

For more documentation, read the `.h` files.
